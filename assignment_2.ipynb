    "\n",
    "**Answer:** According to the line graphs, in Sphere function, we see a sharp decrease in the average best fitness over generations, indicating rapid convergence. The patterns are similar in both the sphere functions, meaning we get more consistent results using this. In Ackley function, we see a considerably slower decrease in in the average best fitness compared to the sphere function, indicating slower convergence and much, much higher variability. Thus, we ger less consistent results using this. Between the two functions and dimensions, the performance varies due to the differences in the complexity of its optimization landscape. The higher dimensional spaces are proving to be tougher for optimization algorithms. The graphs also show differences in convergence speed, stability and final fitness values. These differences in performance are because of the distinct characteristics of their optimization landscapes. \n",

    "**Answer:** The results I received were a bit random and thus varied, but I was able to consistently get the best fitness scores of 8, 16, and 32 for the cases N=8, 16, and 32 respectively. These scores tell the solutions where no two queens threaten each other. To achieve this result, I initially used a single point crossover and a swap mutation. However I later realized that these methods were not going to be sufficient to find the optimal solutions for larger problem sizes. To improve these results, I implemented a scramble mutation which shuffles a subset of the genes in an individual. However, it didn't work the way I expected it to. After this, I tried implementing elitism in the survivor selection step, where the best individuals from each generation are carried over to the next generation. This helped ensure the quality of population did not degrade over time. By experimenting with different parameters and evolutionary operators, I was able to find the optimal solutions for N=8, N=16 and N=32 cases."

    "**Answer**: The average performance of the algorithm seems to be the best for sphere function with 10 dimensions. sphere function with 50 dimensions is comparatively showing a lower value then sphere with 10 dimensions. in Ackley functions, the average fitness seems to be lower than the 10-dimensional sphere case. This suggests that EA finds it more challenging to optimize for Ackley function compared to sphere function, even with the same no. of dimensions.\n",
